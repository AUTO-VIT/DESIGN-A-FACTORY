# üß± DESIGN A FACTORY ‚Äì BRICK EDITION

## OBJECTIVE
Design and optimize your own **brick factory** to meet a **target annual output** while balancing **capacity, reliability, and cost**.

Your design must include the following production stages:
1. **Raw Preparation ‚Üí Mixers**
2. **Shaping ‚Üí Extruders**
3. **Drying + Firing**
4. **Final Handling ‚Üí Packaging**

- **Annual Target Output:** 200,000,000 finished bricks/year  
- **Working Days:** 350 days/year  
- **Shifts per Day:** 3  
- **Hours per Shift:** 7  
- **Total Working Hours per Year:** 7,350 hr/year  
- **Required Dispatch Rate:** **‚âà 27,000 finished bricks/hour**

Your goal is to design a factory that **reaches or exceeds** this throughput while staying **within budget** and maintaining **reliability**.
Each stage must be sized carefully so the **slowest stage** doesn‚Äôt limit your production rate.

---

## HOW TO PLAY
- You will choose **one machine per stage**, except: (not to share to players)
  - **Extrusion:** requires **two or more** parallel machines.
  - **Packaging:** can have **one or more** parallel machines.
- Firing is built into the **Drying + Firing** stage ‚Äî it will not be a bottleneck.
- You must stay **within the total budget of 12 cost points**. (can share)
- The **factory throughput** is the **minimum effective capacity** of all stages. (can share)
- The **winner** is the team that: (or other parameter)
  1. Meets or exceeds 27,000 bricks/hour,
  2. Stays within the budget,
  3. Has the **lowest cost** and **highest reliability**.

| **Beta Mixer** | High-torque heavy-duty | 78 | 0.92 | **71.8** | 4 | 3.0 |

> Each ton of clay ‚âà **353 green bricks** after shaping and moisture adjustment.

---

### Stage 2: Shaping ‚Äì Extruders (parallel **required**)
| Model | Description | Cap. (bricks/hr) | Uptime | Eff. Cap./unit | Cost (each) | Fail% |
|--------|--------------|----------------:|-------:|----------------:|-------------:|------:|

##  BEHIND THE SCENES (organizer-only logic)

<img width="225" height="225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12d18845-0d12-4eb3-8903-2241117efc51" />

- Background losses (drying shrinkage 5%, ignition 3%) are simulated internally.  
- Firing is oversized and will not bottleneck output.  
- Players only balance **capacity**, **cost**, and **reliability**.  
- You can introduce **random events** (e.g., breakdowns or surges) in bonus rounds.

These calculations run **in the background** of the game.  
Players will only pick machines, but the simulation internally converts **tons of clay input ‚Üí finished fired bricks** using the following parameters and flow.

### Step 1: Constants
| Parameter | Symbol | Value | Notes |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Clay density | œÅ | 2000 kg/m¬≥ | Average clay solids |
| Green brick moisture | M‚Ççg‚Çé | 15% | Water before drying |
| Drying shrinkage | S‚Ççd‚Çé | 5% | Volume/mass loss |
| Ignition loss | L‚Ççf‚Çé | 3% | Burnout in firing |
| Working hours/year | H‚Ççy‚Çé | 7350 hr | (350 days √ó 3 √ó 7) |
| Target output | B‚Ççy‚Çé | 200M bricks | Annual requirement |

---

### Step 2: Unit Conversions
| Stage | Input | Output | Conversion |
|--------|--------|---------|------------|
| Mixer | tons clay | green bricks | 1 ton = 353 bricks |
| Extrusion | green bricks | shaped bricks | √ó0.85 |
| Drying | shaped ‚Üí dry | √ó0.95 |
| Firing | dry ‚Üí fired | √ó0.97 |

---

### Step 3: Backend Flow
```text
Green_bricks = Mixer_eff_cap √ó 353
Shaped_bricks = Green_bricks √ó 0.85
Dry_bricks = Shaped_bricks √ó 0.95
Fired_bricks = Dry_bricks √ó 0.97
Dispatch = min(Stage capacities)
```
Step 4: Reliability Simulation

Each stage has a Fail% per hour.
For multiple units (extruders, packaging):

Effective Fail% = (Fail%) / (number of units)


Random breakdown event (optional):

if random() < Fail%:
    output = output * 0.8

Step 5: Scoring Logic
if (min(Stage caps) >= 27000) and (TotalCost <= 12):
    score = (Output / 27000) * (Reliability / Cost)
else:
    score = 0

Step 6: Dynamic Event Ideas

Breakdown: one machine temporarily down (simulate Fail%)

Demand Surge: temporary target = 30,000/hr

Energy Cap: disable one dryer or extruder

Rush Order: must reconfigure for new target under 5 minutes

Step 7: Programmer Output Variables
Variable	Unit	Formula
InputClay_tph	tons/hr	Mixer_eff_cap
GreenBricks_hr	bricks/hr	InputClay_tph √ó 353
DryBricks_hr	bricks/hr	GreenBricks_hr √ó 0.85 √ó 0.95
FiredBricks_hr	bricks/hr	DryBricks_hr √ó 0.97
FinalOutput_hr	bricks/hr	min(Stage caps)
AnnualOutput	bricks/year	FinalOutput_hr √ó 7350

##  MATERIAL AND PROCESS BASICS
Your factory converts **raw clay** into **fired bricks**.

| Stage | Process Description | Material Form | Units Used |
|-------|----------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **1. Mixing** | Prepares clay mass with uniform composition | Wet clay | Tons/hour |
| **2. Extrusion** | Shapes clay into wet bricks | Green bricks | Tons/hour ‚Üí bricks/hour |
| **3. Drying + Firing** | Removes moisture and bakes to final hardness | Dry/Fired bricks | Bricks/hour |
| **4. Packaging** | Sorts, stacks, and dispatches | Finished bricks | Bricks/hour |

---

### MATERIAL CONVERSION LOGIC (used internally)
| Factor | Value | Effect |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Green brick moisture | 15% | Adds mass during mixing/extrusion |
| Drying shrinkage | 5% | Volume/mass loss during drying |
| Ignition loss | 3% | Weight loss during firing |
| Clay density | 2,000 kg/m¬≥ | Used for ton calculations |

> The simulator automatically converts **tons of clay input ‚Üí fired bricks output** 
> Players only see machine choices and effective capacities.

## UNDERSTANDING ‚ÄúUPTIME‚Äù AND ‚ÄúEFFECTIVE CAPACITY‚Äù  

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Uptime** | The fraction of total time a machine is expected to be operational (accounts for maintenance or breakdowns). | 0.90 uptime = 90% available during operation. |
| **Eff. Cap.** | The *actual usable capacity*, calculated as:<br>**Eff. Cap. = Nameplate Capacity √ó Uptime** | 34,000 √ó 0.90 = **30,600** bricks/hr. |

> Real factories never run at 100%. Downtime reduces effective capacity and impacts planning.
